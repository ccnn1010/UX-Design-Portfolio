                    <blockquote>How can I improve the display of information and help the company be taken more seriously in the industry?</blockquote>
                    <h3>Contextual Inquiry</h3>
                    <p>As the Cedrion company already had an established website the process of the re-design and development was significantly different to the creation of the study application featured in project 1. The company had specific requirements that could not be altered completely so had to be considered in the design. When conducting research it was first essential to establish clear needs from the company to direct the design process.</p>
                    <p>Contextual Inquiry was conducted to get to know the intended users of the website and to better understand the companies objectives. The following methods were used to collect information:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Questionaire <span class="italic-info"> - Gained more in-depth insights by asking open-ended questions to find out about the company and its stakeholders needs and values.</span>
                      </li>
                      <li>Brainstorm <span class="italic-info"> - In a team analysed and discussed the current website to establish what were effective and ineffective features.</span>
                      </li>
                      <li>Research of existing websites<span class="italic-info"> - Provided information on current trends and features.</span>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="col-12 design-process-image">

              </div> 
                    <h3>Contextual Analysis</h3>
                   <p>The information gathered during the contextual inquiry set a foundation for the design of the website. Some key insights from the research included:</p>
                   <ol>
                    <li>Outdated information.</li>
                    <li>Ineffective display of projects and support.</li>
                    <li>Appearance needed to be more professional to compete in the current market.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Once the research was conducted weekly sprints were established with a weekly progress meeting with the Cedrion team. Due to the Covid-19 situation the project was conducted remotely. This required a flexible but organised approach to ensure effective collaboration, research and meeting deadlines of weekly sprints. The first task was to create wireframes using Figma.  Figma was chosen for easy collaboration with the client and my colleague.</p>

                 <p>After wireframes were created the visual design began. It was important that the colours incorporated existing branding and images provided by the client. It was also important that colours and font were consistent.

                  <h1>Reflection<span class="fullstop">.</span></h1>
                  <p>The project was conducted using SCRUM and Agile methodologies and was an excellent opportunity to combine many of the skills I possess in UX/UI design and Web Development. The project was completed over three months and enabled me to use my creativity to create a professional and modern website. Completing the project remotely due to the COVID-19 situation was also beneficial as it taught me to adapt and keep communication channels open utilising different technologies to achieve this.  Having a three month time limit met that the full UX lifecycle could not be followed. If the project could be split into two parts of design, then development over a longer period I would have liked to conduct user testing on lower fidelity-prototypes and conducted more user research and evaluation.</p>
                   
                  <h3>Final Thoughts:</h3>
                  <p>The Cedrion team were impressed with the result and have launched the website.  As only a team of two, the work completed during this time was phenomenal and it taught me with determination and persistence you can achieve great things. The final website meets the objectives of the brief and will provide the Cedrion company the professional look their website needed to be competitive in their industry.</p>
